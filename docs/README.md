I am a homeless aspiring software developer and as such, working on this code
is a constant uphill battle.  I've been having a blast working and don't
intend to stop but sometimes the challenges of living on the streets makes
it difficult to consistently work.
This library is going to be a constant work in progress
and I'll eventually use it to make some games.<br>
If you find any of this code useful and want to help contribute then please
@ref don donate to help me continue to learn and bring you
quality code and in the future, quality games.
