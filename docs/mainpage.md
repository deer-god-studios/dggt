Welcome to the @ref dggt "DGGT Library": The Deer God Game Tools Library.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to checkout <a href="https://github.com/deer-god-studios/dggt">the source code</a>.<br>
This library is split into several modules and submodules:<br>
- @ref math <br>
Contains useful math functions and classes.
	- @ref lin <br>
	Contains useful linear algebra classes.
- @ref mem <br>
Contains the allocator class, used for giving the user memory on demand as
well as means of freeing and recycling that memory.
- @ref coll <br>
Contains many common collections (eg. linked\_list, stack, queue and more).
These are template based.  It also contains an iterator class used not
only for looping through items in a collection but also helps in memory
management.
- @ref str <br>
Contains classes and functions used for processing strings of characters.
- @ref tmpl <br>
A very basic template meta-programming library.
- @ref phy <br>
Contains classes and functions for physics simulations.
	- @ref phycoll <br>
	Contains classes and functions used in detecting and reacting to collisions.
- @ref debug <br>
Contains an infrastructure used for debugging game projects.
	- @ref log <br>
	Contains a system for logging and reporting errors and warnings.
