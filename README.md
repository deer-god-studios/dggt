Welcome to the DGGT project, a c++ game development tool library.

I'm a homeless software developer and as such my hardware is in constant peril so I used frequent and liberal use of git for backups in spite of the code base's
working condition.  I try to keep the master branch in working order but it doesn't always work out that way so any broken commits on the master branch should
be marked [BROKEN] and/or [UNTESTED].

The documentation (also a work in progress) can be found <a href="https://deer-god-studios.github.io/docs/html/index.html">here</a>.
If you want to donate to the project you can do so <a href="https://deer-god-studios.github.io/docs/html/de/dd4/don.html">here</a>.

Thank you!
