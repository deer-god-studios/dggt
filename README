DISCLAIMER:

I am a homeless software developer.  As a result of living outside, my laptop is in constant danger of being rained on, stolen, broken or otherwise ruined so
I make frequent and liberal use of GitHub as a backup for my codebase.  This means many of my commits are simply broken or untested.  You've been warned.
To avoid confusion, commits that don't work will be marked with [BROKEN COMMIT] and untested commits will be marked [UNTESTED]

This is a work in progress which I'm continually trying to improve and expand.  Enjoy!

(See docs/README.md for the rest of the documentation.)
