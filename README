DISCLAIMER:

I am a homeless software developer.  As a result of living outside, my laptop is in constant danger of being rained on, stolen, broken or otherwise ruined so
I make frequent and liberal use of GitHub as a backup for my codebase.  This means many of my commits are simply broken or untested.  You've been warned.
To avoid confusion, commits that don't work will be marked with [BROKEN COMMIT] and untested commits will be marked [UNTESTED]

If the library doesn't utilize enough OOP features for you, maybe code review isn't your jam.
