DISCLAIMER:

I am a homeless software developer.  As a result of living outside, my laptop is in constant danger of being rained on, stolen, broken or otherwise ruined so
I make frequent and liberal use of GitHub as a backup for my codebase.  This means many of my commits are simply broken or untested.  You've been warned.

If the library doesn't utilize enough OOP features for you, maybe code review isn't your jam.

Other than that, this is a work in progress which I'm continually trying to improve and expand.  Enjoy!
